# Objective: Develop a system to manage a collection of books with basic CRUD operations.

# Requirements:
* Backend (Node.js  Express):
Set up MongoDB to store book data. Define a schema for books including fields
like title, author, genre, publication date, etc. Create API endpoints for CRUD
operations related to books (GET all books, GET single book by ID, POST new
book, PUT update book details, DELETE a book).

* Frontend (React):
Create a form to add new books with fields for title, author, etc. Display a list of
books fetched from the backend API. Implement functionality to view details of a
specific book, update book details, and delete a book.

* Features:
Implement search/filter functionality by title, author, or genre. Add pagination for
displaying books. Include user authentication for managing books per user.

Backend API functionality for CRUD operations on books.
Frontend implementation using React for data management and display.
Handling of asynchronous operations (fetching data, updating/deleting books,
etc.)
User interface and user experience (UX/UI) design.
